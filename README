Django-EditArea
===============

Django-EditArea is a widget for Django. It adds syntax highlighting to TextField fields on the admin side.

========
Features
========

Django-EditArea is based on EditArea, so it has a whole bunch of features:

* Real-time syntax highlighting
* Search and replace (with regular expressions too!)
* Auto-indenting
* Line numbering
* Full screen mode
* Works alongside popular javascript libraries
* Can be used as a widget in forms
* Very easy to add to a new site or an existing one Ð no complicated setup

============
Installation
============

# Place editarea.py in your Python path. The easiest way to do this is to run setup.py by using:

	python setup.py install


# Place the editarea folder inside a folder called 'js' in the media root of your project. You can override this location by setting the EDITAREA_JS_FOLDER variable (see below).

=====
Usage
=====

Django-EditArea is designed to be easy to use. It defines a new type of field: EditAreaField. EditAreaFields are exactly the same as TextFields, except that they automatically provide html syntax highlighting. To use Django-EditArea, first import it in models.py. Then, use EditAreaField instead of TextField for attributes where you want syntax highlighting. If you are working on an existing project, you can just replace all TextField fields with EditAreaField fields. Since EditAreaField inherits from TextField, you won't lose anything.

=======
Example
=======

Here's a simple model that has an EditAreaField field:

	from django.db import models
	import editarea
	
	# Create your models here.
	class Page(models.Model):
		name    = models.CharField(max_length=128)
		content = editarea.EditAreaField()
	

========================
Overriding the js folder
========================

Normally, you need to put the included editarea folder inside a folder called 'js' inside your media root. If you want to put the editarea folder in a different location, add a variable EDITAREA_JS_FOLDER to settings.py that contains the absolute url to the location. Example:

EDITAREA_JS_FOLDER = "/path/to/my/project/app/media/scripts/"

* Dont forget the trailing slash.
* This should be the path to the folder that contains the editarea folder. i.e. dont include /editarea/ at the end unless the folder containing the editarea folder is also called editarea.
